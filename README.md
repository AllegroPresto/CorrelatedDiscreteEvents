# CorrelatedDiscreteEvents

This repository contains the implementation of the MCMC-based framework introduced in  
*"Correlating Discrete Events: A Scalable Approach for Financial Risk Assessment"* (Scala & Monaco, 2024).  

The code provides **scalable simulations of correlated default events** without relying on copula assumptions, consistent with regulatory practice (Basel IRB / CRR).  
It includes scripts to reproduce the numerical experiments and figures presented in the paper.
